Game developers will focus on game logic and alow game designers to be able to configure the game in depth (covered in the next section).\n\n\nGame Designers\n\n\nGame designers do not need to know how to write Java; they can modify existing games just by editing values in a JSON file. That allows game designers to quickly try out new things without relying on a game developer. They can even make completly new games, just by combinding and configuring existing features.\n\n\nMainly, game designers will work with game developers. Game developers create the game logic, and game designers decide how that logic is implemented and transformed into what the player experiences. Game designers can create things like kits, adjust scoreboards, adjust phase times and swap features/phases around with ease.\n\n\nMap Builders\n\n\nMaps define the experience a player has in the game. Each map allows for a completely difference experience of the same game. VGL makes it easy for map builders to set up and configure maps.\n\n\nThey can setup their maps right from the game, marking important locations (spawns, chests, drop points, complex interactive structures, etc.) using skulls. Changes in map configurations, such as skulls, are reflected immediately in the game without input from a game developer or designer.\n\n\nServer Admins\n\n\nVGL isn't just a developer framework, it supports the server admins as well. VGL incorporates many functionalities such as a powerful roles system to allow server admins to manage their server with ease.\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\nPlayers make the game. VGL will allow players to easily play their favorite minigames, with support for stuff like elo based matchmaking and extensive stats tracking. They will also like that you have a seamless integration with consistency, every game UX is the same, making it easy to learn new modes.\n\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n\nwe care about every user of this framework, from the game developers up to the end users, and aim to provide the best experience possible for everyone.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nIf you just want to skip to a certain part of the docs appropriate to your role, these links may help.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nThe Doctrine\n\n\nContributing\n\n\n\n\nGame developers:\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper area\n\n\n\n\nGame designers:\n\n\n\n\nDesigner area\n\n\n\n\nMap builders:\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to maps",

That way you can throw all your Worldedits and Voxelsnipers on there and using them without fearing any interference. \nIf you work alone, you can just setup a local server, since you will need to use mcedit to delete chunks, this saves you from downloading the map.\n\nWhile building, think about where special positions like spawns or objectives should be located. You don't need to set them now, but you will need to do that when you import the map into VGL.  \n\n\nImporting into VGL\n\n\nOnce you builded your map, add it to a server which has VGL installed. This can be a local server or a remote test server. I wouldn't recommend to do this on a production server, but it should work too.\n\nJust place the map in the root foler of your server, next to the world and world_nether folders.\n\nVGL has a chat based wizard like interface to import your map. Start it with \n/wc start\n.    \n\n\n\n\nYou will see a promt asking you for the name. Click the promt and enter the name of the world (the name of the folder you uploaded). \n    Don't worry, this is not the display name players will see.  \n\n\nThis will start the edit mode and you will be teleported to the world spawn.\n\n    The edit mode is similar to other gamemodes VGL offers, but you are not expected to show off your PvP abilities here. This mode is designed to allow you to easily modify the special locations of the map.\n\n    You will now see a promt to select the center of the map. This is not the spawn for the players, this is only used for scanning for markers and preloading chunks.\n\n\nOnce you set a center, you will be promted to select the radius. Again, just for internal stuff, it doesn't really need to be percice, if you set it too large, creating the world might take some time.\n\n\nAfter setting the radius, you will be asked for a display name. This is the name the players will see. \n\n\nNow that you have the name set, you can set the author. This can be your name, a list of names or the name of your build team. It doesn't really matter, its just a nice way of crediting the creators.\n\n\nNow we have all that done, we can configure the gamemodes. The wizard will show you a list of all currently installed gamemodes, you can select one by clicking it. Once you selected all gamemodes, press done.\n\n\nNow we can get to the fun part: setting all markers.

Features are the modular core of VGL.\n\nYou should try to create as many features as possible so that game designers can easily remix them into new games.  \n\n\nA feature consits of multile parts:\n\n\n\n\nA @FeatureInfo annotation\n   \n\n\n@Expose'd variables\n   \n\n\nEvent Handlers\n  \n\n\nDependencies\n  \n\n\nstart/stop/tick methods\n    \n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nA feature extends \nAbstractFeature\n.\n\nYou can access other features (make sure you read about \ndependencies\n first) by calling\n\nYourFeature feature = getPhase().getFeature(YourFeature.class);\n\nYou can find a list of existing features \nhere\n or you can look into \n\nthe features package\n \nVGL has.\n\n\n@FeatureInfo\n\n\nThe feature info adds some metadata to features, that is used to generate documentation. its fairly straight \nforward. Take a look at this example: \n\n@FeatureInfo(name = \nNoBlockBreakFeature\n, author = \nMiniDigger\n, version = \n1.0\n, description = \nSmall feature that blocks block breaking if active\n)\n\n\nExposed Variables\n\n\nIts always a good idea to expose as many vars as possible. Exposed vars will end up in the game definitions, so that\ngame designers can easily adjust them if needed.\n\nYou have to be careful to what you expose, not every type can be easily serialized! (if you are missing a type, there is currently no way to add a custom type adapter, \ncreate an issue on github and we will look into that)\n\nLets look back at our NoBlockBreakFeature:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n@Expose\n\n\nprivate\n \nMaterial\n[]\n \nwhitelist\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nMaterial\n[\n0\n];\n\n\n@Expose\n\n\nprivate\n \nMaterial\n[]\n \nblacklist\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nMaterial\n[\n0\n];\n\n\n\n\n\nIt exposes a material black and whitelist. Its important to have a default value so that you don't end up dealing with nulls.\nVGL will make sure that if a game designer modified the values, those fields will be updated.\n\n\nEvent Handlers\n\n\nThere are two types of event handlers in VGL: normal \n@EventHandler\ns and \n@GameEvent\ns. \nThe \n@EventHandler\n annotation works like in every other bukkit plugin, but you need to make sure that you only handle events, that are related \nto the game the feature runs in. You don't want the NoBlockBreakFeature of the SurvivalGames game affect the Bedwars game that is currently running too!\n\nThats where \n@GameEvent\n comes in. It tries to figure out if the event was caused by a player and only forward it to your method, if the player plays in the game the\nfeature is attached too.
